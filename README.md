# Blog-Project_React

This is a react project that  allows a user to retrieve blog posts from different API endpoints. 
A user can access the users and post details for each blog, in addition it  also creates a new user to the blog.
The project focuses on  fundamental bases of React APPs using  functional components. Included in this project are:
Bootstrap(to style theCSS),Axios(to make API calls),React-router(to route components),  and JSON server for my backend data.
I chose to use Axios to make API calls because of the easiness of use.  In this poroject, I created a base API component that stored the main url of the APP, and then created sub-components with functions that  that has the Axios methods like: get,post,delete to make the API calls. JSON server is what I used for my backend. I was able to create the Restful API so that I can perform the CRUD operations, and actually visualized the changing of data as I interact with it. When having many components in a project, React-Router makes it easy to route each component , and visualize the interaction of the user has it happens.
